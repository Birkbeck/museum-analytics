The collections were being transferred to the National Emergency Services Museum in Sheffield. Generating enough income to maintain the museum's overheads was described in the trust's 2019 accounts as a challenge. The lease on the premises was due to expire in June 2020 and Doncaster Council were not prepared to extend it further. The Victoria Cross Trust had been facing insolvency in May 2019, apparently due to long term financial mismanagement, which may have contributed to the decision to close. The Charity Commission removed a warning notice from the charity in November 2020. https://www.facebook.com/TheVictoriaCrossTrust/photos/a.189694242511561/217572849723700/?type=3"

In the 1970s the displays were expanded and relocated to Honeybourne House where the company's archives and pattern books were also housed and we date the start of the museum to this period. Stevens and Williams Limited were reconstituted as Royal Brierley Crystal Limited in 1985. Trading difficulties in the 1990s prompted the sale of the bulk of the Honeybourne Museum collection. The museum was closed in 1997 with the collection being liquidated to provide funds for an attempted recapitalisation of the business. This was sold at Sotheby's on 3 March 1998 and a small number of items were retained by the family. When the site was sold the remaining glass stocks including those museum pieces were sold to a private buyer who sold the stock off slowly at a temporary shop in Dudley. The museum pieces were on show in that shop for a few years or maybe longer. Finally the tradename of the company and the remaining museum pieces were sold to Dartington Crystal Ltd who are thought to still own them.

Norton decided that best way to safeguard the museum was to transfer it to the local authority, which happened in 1992. Visitor numbers decreased and the local authority decided to close the museum in 2008. Lengthy negotiations took place between the Council and Norton and ultimately a trust was set up and the council agreed to sell the building and collections to the Trust.

(Devolved 2015 - There is a history of museum collections in the town since 1932 and it appears that a museum was opened to the public in 1939. The museum moved to its current premises in 1996 (the year of foundation given in the domus data). The collections appear to be owned by the Herne Bay Historical Records Society and the museum was operated by this group until 1996. At this point it seems that the collections were loaned to Canterbury City Council who administered the museum (but there is also an indication that the Council own some of the collection). In 2015 the Herne Bay Museum Trust had their tender accepted by the Council to manage and operate the museum). Previously known as Herne Bay Museum and Gallery (changed in 2015)

Finding a new site was difficult due to the nature of the collection and there was a dwindling number of volunteers able to support a move. The trustees therefore opted to find another museum willing to take on the collection that could also be a home for existing volunteers wishing to continue working with it. The collection was dispersed among aviation museums, most notably the City of Norwich Aviation Museum, which is erecting a new building with help from F and WNAM funds.
