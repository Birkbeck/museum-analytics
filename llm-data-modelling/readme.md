# Experimenting with LLMs for Data Modelling

This directory contains scripts for experimenting with the use of LLMs to generate entity/relation data models and the results found when running these experiments.

These files are an accompaniment to the paper: Wright, Ballatore, Poulovassilis, and Wood _From notes to models: Leveraging LLMs for museum closure data_ presented at [TPDL 2025](https://tpdl2025.github.io/index.html).

The `results` directory contains csv files which enumerate the parameters tested and their effect on the performance of the model [Llama 3.1 8B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct).

The file `results/best_model.json` contains the data model generated by the best performing configuration.

## Running the scripts

Running these scripts requires the following libraries to be installed:

- `levenshtein`
- `pandas`
- `torch`
- `transformers`

These can all be installed using `pip`.

Running the experiments also requires the spreadsheet containing unstructured notes, but we are not yet able to make these notes available.
